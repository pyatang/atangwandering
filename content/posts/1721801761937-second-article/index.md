3. Look about you quickly. Close your eyes, and deseribe in detail what you saw. Again look about you, and repeat the ex- ereise, endeavoring to add to your first enumeration of details.
4. Occasionally describe from memory various objects, scenes, or events, such as a flower, tree, building, church, land- seape, the sky, sea, country, or a dinner, meeting, procession, race, game, or jour- ney.
5. Write out a detailed deseription of something you have recently seen. 
6. Read a page in a book, then write out a resum√© in your own words.
